# :material-fingerprint:{ .md .middle } Supported Clients

Here you can find minimum requirements for proper connection using BPB Panel and also download latest version of clients. This feature is added to Telegram bot too.

There are some other clients which perform very well and listed in some subscriptions, however they are not listed here due to lack of continuous development or incompatibility with standard cores' configuration formats.

!!! note "Why there is no Surge, Loon or Quantumult X row"
    These clients only accept subscription bodies in their own INI-style formats (Surge/Loon `Name = vless, ...` lines, Quantumult X `server_remote` sections), and Quantumult X has no VLESS support at all. BPB serves standard URI lists, Xray/sing-box JSON, or Clash YAML — so a one-tap link would import garbage, and the honest option is to leave them out.

## One-click subscription import

The subscription pages offer a **one-click add** button for each client. The panel detects your device's operating system and, when the client exists on it, hands the subscription to the app in a single tap — either with a deep link or (for the WireGuard family) a config archive download (unpack it, then open a .conf file in the app).

On an operating system a client does not ship on, the button copies the subscription link instead and shows you where the app is available, so it never opens a link your device cannot use.

A few details are not visible in the table:

- **`v2rayN(G)`** is a combined row: on Android it resolves to **v2rayNG** (and its link fires `v2rayng://`), on desktop it resolves to **v2rayN** (copy). The notification names the resolved app.
- On the **raw** subscription rows the body is a base64 URI list, which only some importers parse. A client whose importer reads structured profiles only (Streisand, for example) falls back to **copy** there; the deep links above apply to the normal / fragment / warp / warp-pro rows.
- **`PassWall`** is a router add-on for OpenWrt, not a client app — its button always copies the link and says it is not available on this device.
- **`V2Box`**, **`Happ`** and **`FoXray`** appear on the **raw** rows: their importers read base64 URI lists (FoXray also reads structured profiles). After V2Box or Happ imports, open the app's subscription menu and refresh if the configs do not appear right away — the same applies to v2rayNG and MahsaNG.
- **`Hiddify`** registers its Windows/macOS/Linux protocol handlers at first launch, so on a fresh desktop install you may need to open Hiddify once before the button can hand the subscription over.

Some clients register the same URL scheme as others (`clashmeta`, `v2rayng` and `sing-box` are also claimed by Hiddify, for example). When several such apps are installed, the operating system may open another one — that app can still import the same subscription, and the plain link is copied to your clipboard first.

The device OS is detected from the user agent; iPadOS is recognized correctly even in desktop-class browsing mode, so it is never mistaken for macOS.

Legend:

- **deep link** — one tap opens the app and imports the subscription.
- **copy** — the app runs here but has no link scheme, so the subscription link is copied for you to paste into the app.
- **file** — no deep link exists; the sub endpoint serves a ZIP archive of config files, so the button downloads it and you open one `.conf` with the app (WireGuard family).
- **—** — no app build for this operating system; the button copies the link and notes where the app is available.
